    Why are there two expected results for this test?

    This Bite can be interpreted in two ways:

    1. A slice of size n moved from one end of the string to the other
    2. A continual rotation, character by character, n number of times

    Both interpretations result in identical output, except in the case
    where the rotation size exceeds the length of the string.

    Case 1) With a slice method, slicing an entire string and placing
    it at either the beginning or end of itself simply results in the
    the original string = expected_solution1

    Case 2) With a continual rotation, rotating the string len(string)
    number of times produces a string idential to the original string.
    This means any additional rotations can be considered equivalent to
    rotating the string by rotations % len(string) = expected_solution2
