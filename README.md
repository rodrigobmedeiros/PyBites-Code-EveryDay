# PyBites - Code Every Day Project

This repo will be used to solve pybites from [Py bites Challenges](https://codechalleng.es). There are more the 270 python challenges and the idea is solve at least one a day. I will include the resolved pybites daily.

# Bite 19 - Write a simple property

Write a simple Promo class. Its constructor receives a name `str` and expires `datetime`.

Add a property called expired which returns a boolean value indicating whether the promo has expired or not.

Checkout the tests and datetime module for more info. Have fun!

Insight: Use @property to create a get method that will be called instead of acess the attribute directly.
