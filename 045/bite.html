<p>How about writing a <em>queue</em> that holds the last 5 items?</p>
<blockquote>Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first. A real-world example of queue can be a single-lane one-way road, where the vehicle enters first, exits first. More real-world examples can be seen as queues at the ticket windows and bus-stops. <small>[<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/dsa_queue.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source</a>]</small></blockquote>
<p>Complete the <code>my_queue</code> function to return a queue-like data type that keeps the last <code>n</code> items.</p>
<p>Check the <em>standard library</em> to see how you can do this in the shortest/most efficient way.</p>
<p>See an example output below and the tests that check for various values of <code>n</code>. Have fun!</p>
