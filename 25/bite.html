<p>In this bite a real world scenario: <i>PyBites has a growing set of Bites and gives away promos.</i> They choose a Bite randomly but don't want to choose the same one again.</p><p>Hence you are provided with a <code>BITES constant</code> and a <code>bites_done set</code> that gets passed into the class via its constructor. Complete the methods in the Promo class:</p><ol><li><code>_pick_random_bite</code> is a helper (<code>_</code> here means private) that picks a randomly available Bite. When no more Bites are available raise a <code>NoBitesAvailable</code> (provided).</li><li><code>new_bite</code> should use this helper and update <code>self.bites_done</code> (<i>it keeps state</i>, the reason we used a class here).</li></ol><p>See also the tests. We hope you learn a thing or two. Enjoy!</p>
