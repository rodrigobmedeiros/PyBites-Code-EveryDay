<p>Although you have to be careful using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_function_recursion.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recursion</a> it is one of those concepts you want to at least understand. It's also commonly used in coding interviews :)</p>
<p>In this beginner Bite we let you rewrite a simple countdown for loop using <em>recursion</em>. See <code>countdown_for</code> below, it produces the following output:</p>
<pre>$ python countdown.py
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
time is up
</pre>
<p>You will be tested on having the same output, making it work with another start value, and of course if you used recursion. Have fun!</p>
