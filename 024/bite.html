<p><code>ABC</code>'s or <code>Abstract Base Classes</code> are great to enforce a common <i>API</i> for your subclasses.</p><p>You define one or more methods and/or properties as abstract in the base class, and if the subclass does not implement them it raises a <code>TypeError</code>. In this bite you will use this concept as follows:</p><ol><li>Define a Challenge base class that inherits from <code>ABC</code> (given), its constructor receives a <code>number</code> and a <code>title</code> attribute.</li><li>On Challenge define an <code>abstractmethod</code> called <code>verify</code> and an <code>property</code> (< 3.3 it would be an <code>abstractproperty</code>) called <code>pretty_title</code>.</li><li>Create the <code>BlogChallenge</code> and <code>BiteChallenge</code> classes which both inherit from <code>Challenge</code>. <i>Note that they would raise a <code>TypeError</code> at this point, exactly what you want: enforcing the use of the abstract method/ property.</i></li><li><code>BlogChallenge</code> and <code>BiteChallenge</code>'s constructors call the parent constructor (don't worry it's <i>super</i>cool, remember: <strong>we use Python3</strong> so adjust your syntax), and both receive an extra argument in the constructor: <code>merged_prs</code> for <code>BlogChallenge</code> and <code>result</code> for <code>BiteChallenge</code>.</li><li>Implement the required methods and properties, refer to the tests what they need to return.</li></ol><p>Get coding, learn more about classes, and have fun!</p>
