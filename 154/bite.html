<p>As you <a href="https://codechalleng.es/news">might have noticed</a> we are now on Python 3.7 so time for a Bite on <i>data classes</i> which were introduced with <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0557/" target="_blank">PEP 557</a>.</p><p>What are they? Raymond Hettinger summarized it nicely <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-TwcmT6Rcw" target="_blank">in his great talk</a>: <i>a mutible named tuple with defaults</i>.</p><p>One advantage is the code it saves you typing so they might become an essential part of your Python toolkit!</p><p>In this Bite we have you write a data class called <code>Bite</code> that managed 3 attributes: <i>number</i>, <i>title</i>, and <i>level</i>. Their types are <code>int</code>, <code>str</code> and <code>str</code> respectively.</p><p>There are 3 more requirements:<ol><li><i>title</i> needs to be capitalized upon instantiation (you get a hint in the tests for this one :) - make sure to read the tests for additonal specs, including some of the differences between <code>data class</code>es and <code>namedtuple</code>s!)</li><li><i>level</i> takes a default argument of <i>Beginner</i>.</li><li>A collection of Bite instances needs to be orderable (using <code>sort</code> / <code>sorted</code> - this is not by default but configurable ...)</li></ol></p><p>Good luck and keep up with the language, exciting new things are getting added!<br>On that note feel free to make us more Bite requests via our <a href="https://codechalleng.es/bites/">Bites homepage</a> (you'll find a form per Bite level at the bottom of the page ...)</p><p>For more resources on <i>data classes</i> we recommned watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-TwcmT6Rcw" target="_blank">Hettinger's talk</a> as well as reading through Anthony Shaw's <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-brief-tour-of-python-3-7-data-classes-22ee5e046517" target="_blank">A brief tour of Python 3.7 data classes</a>. Have fun!</p>
