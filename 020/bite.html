<p>Write a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers" target="_blank">context manager</a> to roll back a transaction on the given <code>Account</code> class.</p><p>There are two <i>special (aka <i>dunder</i>) methods</i> you need to define to create a context manager (there is also a convenient decorator - see <a href="https://codechalleng.es/bites/88/">Bite 88</a>).</p><p>The purpose of the context manager is to roll back any transaction that will make the balance go below 0 (debt  != cool). The rest of the class is already defined so you can focus on the context manager part.</p><p>See the tests for more detail. Good luck and keep calm and code in Python!</p>
